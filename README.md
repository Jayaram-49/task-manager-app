## 💡 Key React Concepts Used

- **Component-Based Design** – App broken into reusable, single-responsibility components
- **useState Hook** – Local state for tasks, filters, search, edit mode, and toast
- **useEffect Hook** – Syncs task state to localStorage on every change
- **useCallback Hook** – Memoizes event handlers for performance
- **Controlled Inputs** – All form fields are fully controlled components
- **Lifting State Up** – Shared state managed in `App.js`, passed as props
- **Conditional Rendering** – Empty states, edit mode, overdue indicators
